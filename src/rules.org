* Introduction
  This document lists out the rules for living at Milestone
  Apartments.

* Rules
  1. Gates are closed and one of the gates is locked at
     10:30 PM.  Each apartment is given a key that is used
     to unlock the first gate.  Using this gate, a person
     enters, opens the second gate, parks the car, locks the
     first gate from outside, and bolts the second gate from
     inside.

  2. The garbage is put outside the apartment in a closed
     *bin* in the morning by 7:00 AM for the pick up.
     Please do not use plastic covers.  They will invariably
     leak and smell.

  3. Vehicles are parked only in their allocated places.

  4. Flowers, fruits, vegetables or leaves are not plucked
     from the garden.

  5. Litter is not thrown down from the apartments.

  6. Terrace is a restricted area.

  7. Problems with plumbing, electrical or any other problem
     with the apartment are immediately reported to the
     watchman.
